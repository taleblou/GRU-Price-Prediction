# **GRU Model for Financial Predictions**

This repository contains the initial implementation of a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) model designed for financial predictions across multiple asset classes. This model aims to provide accurate forecasts for various financial instruments, including indices, cryptocurrencies, commodities, and currency pairs. Below, you will find detailed performance metrics for each asset class and links to external resources that complement this project.

## **About This Project**

This GRU model is an initial implementation, released for public use. The project demonstrates the potential of deep learning models for financial predictions. While this repository focuses on GRU, I have also utilized other models, the code for which is available on my GitHub[https://github.com/taleblou/].

## **How to Use**

1. Clone this repository.  
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Prepare your dataset and follow the instructions in the notebook or script.  
4. Run the model and evaluate its performance using the provided metrics.
